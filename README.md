# Math Foundation

I have been trying to get into data science and machine learning for a while now and I finally decided to take the plunge.

This is a github tracker for all that I learn in the process.

The repository is divided into 3 parts:

1. Concepts
2. Code
3. Tracker

I plan on slowly and consistently updating this repository with all that I learn.
