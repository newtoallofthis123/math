### Overall

Overall summary of the day's work:

5 - Great

### Covered

Any work that was covered during the day:

Since this was the first day I was starting my journey, I wanted to get a few things done ASAP.



I obviously wanted a tracker of kind where I can track my progress and a script ecosystem where I can abstract the whole process of creating new tracker files



I chose the GitHub repository way of management and I initialized my GitHub Repository.



I planned out the initial tracker system structure and quickly wrote out some quick python scripts that would help me have a GUI for adding my progress. 



After writing a quick server with flask, I made a GUI and I am currently writing in it.

It needs a lot of work, but it works so.



I am quite excited to finally start learning tomorrow

### Pending

- Improve the tracker scripts
