# Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

Statistics is the heart of data driven decision making. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data.

Data in itself is not useful. It is the interpretation of data that leads to knowledge and wisdom. Statistics is the science of learning from data. It is the art of extracting knowledge from data.
The way to envision data is to think of them like snapshots of reality. Data are the facts and figures collected, analyzed, and summarized for presentation and interpretation.

## Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics

Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that involves the organization, summarization, and display of data. Descriptive statistics describes data through numerical summaries, tables, and graphs. The goal of descriptive statistics is to describe the data in a way that is understandable and meaningful.

Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that involves using a sample to draw conclusions about a population. Inferential statistics uses probability to make inferences about a population. The goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample.

## Few Important Terms

1. **Population**: A population is the entire group of individuals or objects to be studied. The population is the complete collection to be studied; it includes all subjects of interest. The population is the entire group of individuals or objects to be studied.

2. **Sample**: A sample is a subset of the population that is being studied. A sample is a subset of the population that is being studied.
For example, isn't it easier to count the number of people in a classroom than to count the number of people in a city? The classroom is the sample and the city is the population.

3. **Parameter**: A parameter is a numerical measurement describing some characteristic of a population.

4. **Bias**: Bias is the tendency of a measurement process to over- or under-estimate the value of a population parameter. It is the skewing of data in a particular direction, away from the true value. There is this tendency in which particular groups is more likely to include themselves in a sample and is known as self-selection bias.

## Descriptive Statistics

### Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency are measures that locate the center of a distribution of data. The mean, median, and mode are the three most commonly used measures of central tendency.

### Mean and Weighted Mean

Mean is the average of a set of values. As simple as that. The operation is also quite simple. You add up all the values and divide by the number of values. The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. It is the arithmetic average of a set of values. The mean is the sum of the values divided by the number of values.

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$

Weighted mean on the other hand doesn't give an equal weight to all the values. It is the sum of the product of the values and their weights divided by the sum of the weights.

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$$

The weight is determined by the magnitude of the value. The larger the value, the larger the weight. The smaller the value, the smaller the weight.

To calculate the weights,

$$w_i = \frac{x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}$$

Hence effectively,

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}$$

### Median

The median is the midpoint of a distribution of data. It is the value that divides the data into two equal parts. Half the values are less than or equal to the median and half the values are greater than or equal to the median. The median is the middle value when the data are arranged in order of increasing magnitude.

Medians are particularly useful when the data are skewed. The median is the middle value when the data are arranged in order of increasing magnitude.

> Media is a quantile. That means it cuts 50% of the data. The median is the 50th percentile. Whereas we also have others like quartiles (25th, 50th, 75th) and deciles (10th, 20th, 30th, 40th, 50th, 60th, 70th, 80th, 90th).

### Mode

Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set. A data set can have more than one mode. A data set with two modes is called bimodal. A data set with more than two modes is called multimodal.
