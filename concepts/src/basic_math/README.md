# Numbers and Basics

Number theory describes the properties of numbers in general, and integers in particular. It is a vast and fascinating subject, with applications in cryptography, computer science, and even music theory. In this section, we will cover some of the most important concepts in number theory, including divisibility, prime numbers, and modular arithmetic.

## PEDMAS

PEDMAS or BODMAS is a rule that tells us the order in which we should solve a mathematical expression. It stands for:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Division
4. Multiplication
5. Addition
6. Subtraction

This is the order that most of mathematical operations follow.
This standard is followed by most of the programming languages as well.

$2 + 3 * 5 = 17$

## Functions

Functions in math are similar to functions in programming. They take an input and give an output. The input is called the argument of the function and the output is called the value of the function.

$x^2$ is a function that takes an input $x$ and gives an output $x^2$.

This can be similarly expressed in python

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2

y = f(5)
```

Cool right?

When we draw the graph of this, we get a linear graph that looks similar to this:

## Exponents
